          <p class="desc">Koalas are cute, tree-dwelling marsupials native to Australia. They have fluffy gray fur and large, round faces. Koalas primarily eat eucalyptus leaves, which make up their entire diet. They are known for their slow movements and sleep a lot, sometimes up to 20 hours a day. Koalas have strong claws for gripping tree branches, and they rarely come down to the ground. They carry and nurse their tiny, underdeveloped babies in pouches. Koalas are iconic Australian animals and are protected due to habitat loss and disease threats.</p>

It's known for its strong jaws, fierce temperament, and distinctive screeching sounds. These nocturnal animals eat carrion (dead animals) and are currently endangered due to a contagious facial cancer called Devil Facial Tumor Disease. They have unique reproductive methods, and conservation efforts are in place to protect them.</p>
